    <h4>Discoverability:</h4>
    <p>
      <b>Affordances</b> - The design allows users to click on different states which provides an overall micro summary of that state in relation to the federal data (macro summary) <br>
      <b>Signifiers</b> - The design provides clickable buttons with the state name to signify that the button can be clicked to provide more information (leads to micro summary)<br>
      <b>Constraints</b> - The design currently does not provide any constraints <br>
      <b>Mappings</b> - The design currently does not provide any mappings <br>
      <b>Feedback</b> - The design currently does not provide any feedback
    </p>

    <h4>Usability:</h4>
    <p>
      <b>Accesibility</b> - The design has not considered differently-abled individuals <br>
      <b>Ease</b> - The design can be used efficiently with the buttons and drop down menu in place<br>
      <b>Tolerance</b> - The design does not take into account user risk, however, the product should not cause any harm<br>
      <b>Flexiblity</b> - The design incorporates a drop down menu, allowing users to see select types of data<br>
      <b>Perceptibility</b> - The design does not yet include anything related to accessibility<br>
      <b>Comfort</b> - The design seems to be an appropriate size and space; this will be modified when we create the map and data<br>
      <b>Iterability</b> - Yes, the design can evolve without being completely done; the only difference between the next version is including more easy to use features
    </p>

    <h4>Cultural Context:</h4>
    <p>
      <b>Equity</b> - The design is accessible to anyone as long as they have access to a smart device<br>
      <b>Political Intent</b> - The design intentionally seeks to help reduce the incarcerated rate by providing the high rates throughout the United States<br>

    <h3>Division of Labor</h3>
    <p>We decided to divide our labor in terms of specific tasks to be done for each milestone</p>
    <p>We have a Github Projects page within our repository where tasks are divided into To-Do and completed categories</p>
    <p>For each milestone we will create a number of tasks and divvy up an approximately equal number of those tasks to each person</p>

    <h3>about.html Requirements</h3>
    <ul>

      <li> Pictures and analysis of the Lo-Fi wireframe sketches, including:</li>
        <li>Evaluation of each wireframe form the required number of UX design perspectives</li>
        <li>Elements selected from each wireframe, and why, for your final design</li>
